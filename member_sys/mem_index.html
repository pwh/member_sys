This is a quick guide to the web pages related to membership, with links.<br>

The following link lets you create a profile.
We recommend including an email address and cottage location
in your profile.

<blockquote>
<a href="mem_profile.php?adduser">Register a new user</a>
</blockquote>

The registration page includes a link to the sign in page.
Also, once you've registered you can sign in anytime using the following link.

<blockquote>
<a href="mem_signin.php">Sign in</a>
</blockquote>

Once signed in, you can edit your profile.
Adding contact information helps the administrator identify or contact
you.
Your phone numbers and/or email addreses will be seen by other members,
unless you indicate otherwise.
There are two profile pages; the first lets you change basic name and
password items, and the second is for contact information:
<blockquote><a href="mem_profile.php">Update basic profile</a><br>
<a href="mem_profile_xtra.php">Update contact information</a>
</blockquote>

Once the membership administrator records payment of your dues, you can view
the members-only pages.
This link provides a quick summary of your current status:
<blockquote> 
<a href="mem_status.php">Membership status</a>
</blockquote>

Please remember to sign out at the end of your session:
<blockquote>
<a href="mem_signout.php">Sign out</a>
</blockquote><br>

Note: These pages require support for session cookies in your
web browser, and the option to remember your username between sessions requires
persistent cookies.

(Restricted pages used to manage membership data are described
<a href="admin/mem_admin_index.php">here</a>.)
